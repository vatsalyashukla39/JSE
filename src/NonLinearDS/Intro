Till now all the DS that we have covered were linear DS


for ex:
the file system in our comp requires multiple drives having multiple folders nd every folders hv multiple files
similarly friend list of a social media profile like facebook requires to rep 1 user having multiple nd each of those frnds further hv multiple frnds
to rep such type of info we use non linear DS

Types of non linear DS:
We hv 3 types of non linear DS called as:
 1)tree
 2)Graph
 3)Heap
