Definition : Heap is a complete binary tree in which the parent and child elements share relationship. The relationship is that:
Either the parent is greater than it's both the children or it is smaller than both the children. In the 1st case heap is
called max heap and the 2nd case heap is called min heap.

#Algorithm for inserting data in heap:
1)Add the new element at the end of the heap as child node.
2)Compare the newly added element with the parent node.
3)If it is smaller than the parent node return.
4)Else then:
  a)Swap with the parent element.
  b)Goto step 2 and continue until condition of heap is satisfied.

#Algorithm for deleting root of the heap:
1)Copy the last element at the root node.
2)Reduce the array size by 1.
3)Check whether the new root satisfy the heap condition
4)If heap condition is satisfied then return.
5)Else swap the new root with it's left or right child, whichever is greater.
6)If it has children then goto step 3
7)if it has no child then return.
